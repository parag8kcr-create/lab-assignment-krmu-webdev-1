This is my personal portfolio website created using HTML and CSS to showcase my profile, skills, and projects.
It features clean design, smooth navigation, and a simple contact form.
The site is structured into sections like About, Skills, Projects, and Contact for easy viewing.
It serves as my first step toward learning web development and creative design.
